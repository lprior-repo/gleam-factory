## Iteration 0 - SESSION START

Requirements: ## Implement ACP session/cancel

Add cancel(client, session_id) that sends session/cancel notification to abort running prompts.

### Acceptance Criteria
Cancel stops in-progress generation

Good. Test fails compilation. Implementer must create AcpNotification type with session_id/method fields.
