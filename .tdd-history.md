## Iteration 0 - SESSION START

Requirements: ## Define all Signal types from CUE spec

Create src/signals.gleam with all signal types: TestFailure{file,error,context_hash,timestamp}, TestPassing{hash,timestamp}, BeadAssigned{task_id,spec,requirements,priority,assigned_at}, PatchProposed{diff,author_pid,workspace,hash}, PatchAccepted{hash,merged_at}, PatchRejected{reason}, GoldenMasterUpdated{old_hash,new_hash}, Evolution{new_hash,cause}, LoopSpawned{loop_id,task_id,phase}, LoopComplete{loop_id,task_id,commits,reverts,duration_ms}, LoopFailed{loop_id,reason}, ResourceExhausted{resource,current,limit}

### Acceptance Criteria
All signal types compile with correct field types
