## Iteration 0 - SESSION START

Requirements: ## Define all Signal types from CUE spec

Create src/signals.gleam with all signal types: TestFailure{file,error,context_hash,timestamp}, TestPassing{hash,timestamp}, BeadAssigned{task_id,spec,requirements,priority,assigned_at}, PatchProposed{diff,author_pid,workspace,hash}, PatchAccepted{hash,merged_at}, PatchRejected{reason}, GoldenMasterUpdated{old_hash,new_hash}, Evolution{new_hash,cause}, LoopSpawned{loop_id,task_id,phase}, LoopComplete{loop_id,task_id,commits,reverts,duration_ms}, LoopFailed{loop_id,reason}, ResourceExhausted{resource,current,limit}

### Acceptance Criteria
All signal types compile with correct field types

---

## Iteration 1 - AUDITOR

Perfect! I've written the first focused test for the signals module.

## Test Summary

**Test Name:** `test_failure_signal_has_required_fields_test`

**What it tests:** This test validates that the `TestFailure` signal type can be constructed with all required fields (`file`, `error`, `context_hash`, `timestamp`) and that pattern matching works correctly to extract those fields.

**Why this test design:**

1. **Single responsibility**: Tests one signal type (TestFailure) - the most critical error signal
2. **Tests behavior, not implementation**: Uses pattern matching to verify the signal structure works
3. **Drives clean design**: The implementer must:
   - Create a `signals.gleam` module
   - Define a `TestFailure` type with exactly these 4 fields in the right order
   - Ensure the type is public and constructible
4. **Clear failure message**: When the test runs, it will fail with a clear error about the missing `signals` module

**Current Status:** Test FAILS (red phase) ✓

The implementer now needs to create `src/signals.gleam` with the `TestFailure` type definition to make this test pass. This is the first step toward implementing all 12 signal types as specified in the CUE spec.

## Iteration 1 (attempt 1) - IMPLEMENTER

---

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

**What the test asked for:** A `signals` module with a `TestFailure` type containing four named fields (`file`, `error`, `context_hash`, `timestamp`) that can be constructed and pattern-matched.

**What I implemented:** Created `src/signals.gleam` with a public `TestFailure` type definition matching the test's expectations:

```gleam
pub type TestFailure {
  TestFailure(
    file: String,
    error: String,
    context_hash: String,
    timestamp: String,
  )
}
```

**Why this approach:** This is the minimal implementation the test demands. The test constructs a `TestFailure` signal and pattern-matches on its fields, so providing the public type with the correct field names and types is all that's needed. All 72 tests pass, including the new `test_failure_signal_has_required_fields_test`.

---

## Iteration 2 - AUDITOR

Perfect! The test fails as expected because `TestPassing` doesn't exist yet. This is exactly what we want - the test is now driving the implementation.

## Summary

**What I'm testing:** The presence and correctness of the `TestPassing` signal type.

**Why this test:** 
- It validates that `TestPassing` signal can be constructed with the correct fields (hash and timestamp)
- It ensures the signal can be pattern-matched and accessed properly
- This follows the requirement to "Define all Signal types from CUE spec" and validates that the next signal type (after TestFailure) compiles with correct field types
- The test is minimal and focused - it tests ONE signal type, making it clear what needs to be implemented
- It follows the arrange-act-assert pattern and uses descriptive naming

**Test Design:** 
- Creates a `TestPassing` signal with hash and timestamp fields as specified in requirements
- Verifies both fields are accessible through pattern matching
- Validates the actual values match what was set

The implementer will need to add the `TestPassing` type definition to `src/signals.gleam` to make this test pass. This drives good design by clearly specifying the exact structure needed.
