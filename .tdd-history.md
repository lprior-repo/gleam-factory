# TDD-TCR-REFACTOR Session History

This file tracks the reasoning from each agent to provide context to subsequent agents.

## Iteration 0 - SESSION START

Requirements: ## Implement GPU ticket system

Add request_gpu_ticket(governor) / release_gpu_ticket(governor, ticket). Ticket is simple counter. Block when no tickets available.

### Acceptance Criteria
Ticket acquisition blocks when exhausted, releases work

---

## Iteration 1 - AUDITOR

Test drives the implementation. The test forces:
1. BLOCKING semantics (not Error)
2. FAIRNESS queue (FIFO ordering)
3. RELEASE wakeup (ticket return enables blocked caller)
4. ACTOR state (counter + waiting queue)
5. COMPOSABILITY (governor|>request|>release)
