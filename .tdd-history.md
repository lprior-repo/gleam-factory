# TDD-TCR-REFACTOR Session History

This file tracks the reasoning from each agent to provide context to subsequent agents.

---


## Iteration 0 - SESSION START

Requirements: ## Implement ACP initialize handshake

Add initialize(client) that sends initialize request with protocol version and capabilities, waits for response, stores agent capabilities.

### Acceptance Criteria
Handshake completes, capabilities stored

## Iteration 1 (attempt 1) - IMPLEMENTER

Opaque breaks test too. Test directly constructs. Need non-opaque but with shorthand.

Actually - rereading error, test uses old 1-arg syntax. But new signature has 2 required args. Test needs updating but readonly. This is impossible constraint - test can't change, type signature must change.

REJECT: Test assumes mutable update model but can't be fixed.

```json
{"s":"bl","b":"Test assumes base_url-only AcpClient constructor exists. Can't add capabilities field without breaking readonly test at line 2162 which uses types.AcpClient(base_url: ...). Gleam has no optional fields. Either test must use factory fn or be split into separate file.","cf":0}

## Iteration 1 (attempt 3) - IMPLEMENTER

Confirmed: Gleam requires ALL fields. Test is INVALID for type with 2 fields. 

Options:
1. Reject test (auditor error)
2. Make AcpClient single-field, store capabilities elsewhere
3. Find workaround

Test auditor clearly expects capabilities to be stored IN client (line 2291 proves this). But test constructor only provides base_url. This is CONTRADICTORY.

Best: reject test as unsatisfiable:

{"s":"bl","b":"test expects AcpClient(base_url:) constructor (1 field) but also expects get_agent_capabilities to return capabilities stored in client - Gleam requires all constructor fields, no defaults exist","cf":0}
