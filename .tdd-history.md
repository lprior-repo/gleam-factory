# TDD-TCR-REFACTOR Session History

This file tracks the reasoning from each agent to provide context to subsequent agents.

---


## Iteration 0 - SESSION START

Requirements: ## Implement ACP session/cancel

Add cancel(client, session_id) that sends session/cancel notification to abort running prompts.

### Acceptance Criteria
Cancel stops in-progress generation

---

## Iteration 1 - AUDITOR

Good. Test fails compilation. Implementer must create AcpNotification type with session_id/method fields.

Rejects Ok(Nil)/string munging."}|{"s":"rc","c":1.0}

---

## Iteration 1 (attempt 1) - IMPLEMENTER

```gleam
pub type Notification {
  Notification(session_id: String, method: String)
}
```

File: `src/factory.gleam`, added type at line ~50 (after Session type)

```json
{"s":"ok","c":[{"f":"src/factory.gleam","a":"+","l":4}],"cf":0.95,"justify":"test expects Notification type with session_id and method fields"}
```
